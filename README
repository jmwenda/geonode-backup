===========================================================================
This is a series of bash scripts/commands to be used to perform basic
utilities for a GeoNode instance. This has several case scenarios which
include:
       *Backing up a geonode to a directory- $geonode-backup [origin] [destinati        on]
       *Restoring a geonode from a backup- $geonode-backup /data/geonode-backup/geonode_backup2011Nov4
       *Setting up a mirror by providing two datails the localserver and the remote address of the mirror server $geonode-backup localhost geonode@demo.geonode.org
Hopefully in future we will look into backing up to an S3 service.
While backing up time stamps will be attached and GWC files will not be 
zipped,this is just cleaning and addition of more properties to the following script https://gist.github.com/1318669
========================================================================
To perform a back up/restore to a directory run the following command syntax
geonode-backup account@serverip directory operation
For example:
geonode-backup geonode@horn.rcmrd.org data --backup
geonode-backup geonode@horn.rcmrd.org data/geonode_2011_06_01/ --restore
